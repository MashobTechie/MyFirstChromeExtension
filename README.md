## Chrome Extension: COVID-19 UK Stats Viewer

Built my first Chrome extension to understand browser extension fundamentals such as
**manifests, permissions, content scripts, and UI injection**.

The extension fetches and displays the latest Coronavirus (COVID-19) statistics in the UK
directly in the browser.

This project was built by following and extending a FreeCodeCamp tutorial as a hands-on way
to learn Chrome extension architecture and APIs.

### What I Learned
- Chrome Extension architecture (manifest.json, popup UI)
- Working with browser APIs
- Fetching and displaying external data
- Structuring small frontend projects
- Debugging extensions in Chrome DevTools

### Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- Chrome Extension APIs
- Manifest V3 (manifest.json)
